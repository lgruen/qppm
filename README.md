*Abstract:* The simulation of light transport
often involves specular and transmissive surfaces, which are modeled by functions that
are not square integrable. However, in many practical cases unbiased Monte Carlo methods
are not able to handle such functions efficiently and consistent Monte Carlo methods are
applied. Based on quasi-Monte Carlo integration, a deterministic alternative to the
stochastic approaches is introduced. The new method for deterministic consistent
functional approximation uses deterministic consistent density estimation.
